#                                                           Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Zyad Samy
In this project, I trained multible machine learning models using 2D landmarks and the AFLW2000 dataset which consists of 2000 images annotated with image-level 68-point 3D facial landmarks in a variety of head poses and Mediapipe library that extract 468 points ( X, Y) to estimate the rotation axis (pitch,yaw,roll) for the head in real time
